Without further ado, here’s why you’re taking Physics.</p><h2 id="unrelated-subjects">Unrelated Subjects?</h2><p>First, it’s important to note which courses we’re talking about and why they’re relevant to the field of Computer Science. Most universities require students to complete Physics courses up to and including electromagnetism; of course, some schools go further than that, but that’s the typical “minimum requirement” expected for the degree. This is explained by the prevalence of Physics in a wide variety of Computer Science applications, including but not limited to computer simulations, game engines, robotics, automation, and quantum computing. In each of these fields, having a strong understanding of Physics is essential.</p><p>The same applies to other STEM courses: Trigonometry and Calculus are often used for 2d and 3d rendering, ray tracing, image processing, navigation and tracking, and machine learning. (They’re also necessary for college-level Physics).</p><p>Classes like Discrete Mathematics provides a strong foundation for boolean algebra, formal language, algorithms, data structures, and machine learning—in fact, <a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/fa20/cse20-a/">many</a> <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/">colleges</a> consider Discrete Math to be a Computer Science course for that reason. For every class that you might need to complete a Computer Science degree, you’re bound to find a field of Computer Science that is directly related to that subject or uses it extensively. (These universities have had a lot of time to refine their curriculum, you’d think they know whether a class is useful or not).</p><h2 id="on-specialization">On Specialization</h2><p>During our debate, opponents to my view argued that these courses were much too specialized for specific fields of Computer Science and that they could be irrelevant to a large group of students pursuing the degree. A student who aims to become a web developer does not need to learn the advanced math and physics for quantum computing; essentially, they argued that these courses should be provided as options rather than rigid requirements.</p><p>In response to this, it’s important to note that this is a Computer Science degree we’re talking about; the degree aims to teach about the theory of how computers work and how they can be developed, applied, and optimized. That is to say: Computer Science is much larger than merely learning to code. Some colleges make this distinction by providing a separate Software Engineering major, which focuses on creating programs and systems—a more practical equivalent to the theoretical Computer Science. Computer Scientists do a lot of different things. They invent new algorithms, data structures, software, networking systems, protocols, operating systems, and many more.</p><p>Furthermore, these Computer Science degrees aren’t explicitly meant to prepare you for a specific job; becoming a software engineer after getting a computer science degree is simply a side effect of having this kind of education. One can pursue a career in software engineering without acquiring a degree in Computer Science; and a student who graduates in Computer Science is not necessarily seeking a career in software engineering. Of course, it does help to have this kind of degree because companies are more likely to look at your application; and you will likely have learned some valuable aspects of programming you might otherwise have missed out on, but the point still stands.</p><p>One such aspect of programming that is not directly applicable to most programmers yet very useful is knowledge of assembly. A web developer will likely never need to use assembly, and yet knowing how computers work internally, how compilers convert the code you write into the instructions the CPU runs, and how the way you write your code has an impact on the performance of your program are all very useful in a programmer’s toolkit. If knowing how the CPU runs instructions is a valuable aspect for Computer Scientists to learn, why shouldn’t they also learn how the CPU works with transistors, circuits, and other electromagnetism-related topics? Why stop at assembly when Physics is just as important in the functioning of computers?</p><p>Learning Computer Science is not restricted to learning to write code, and it shouldn’t be. For people looking for a specialized course that focuses on getting a software engineering job, rather than preparing you for the ever-changing field of Computer Science, programming bootcamps are an option. Universities are tailored for a specific broad type of education, allowing students to have a general knowledge of their field and its surroundings. Yet, they still allow people to specialize in the areas they are most interested in for upper-division courses. This is why these universities rarely require you to take the entire Physics series—compared to an actual Physics major, you’re taking considerably fewer classes in the subject because they want you to have a foundation, not a complete in-depth understanding.</p><h2 id="what-youre-truly-learning">What You're Truly Learning</h2><p>Perhaps most importantly, universities’ engineering curriculums are not focused on you receiving this knowledge; there’s a wealth of knowledge on the internet, experts, books, and other resources for people to learn these things independently. Rather, they want you to learn to learn, think, and problem-solve on your own; you are unlikely to remember everything you’ve been taught in university, even if it’s within your major. But having learned to learn and practice properly will allow you to quickly pick those things you forgot back up when the time comes for you to use them.</p><p>Why not learn these skills within the realm of Computer Science through challenging upper-division courses, one might ask? Learning this skill through various subjects teaches you problem-solving even when you are outside of your comfort zone; you can learn to approach problems you’ve never encountered. For a good deal of physics, you’re given a problem in plain wording, asked to create or use pre-existing formulas to solve the problem mathematically, and then use a set of known tools to work through solving the problem. This parallels the problem-solving that is often required in software engineering—what if the problem you’re encountering does not have a Stack Overflow answer readily available?</p><h2 id="are-we-settled">Are We Settled?</h2><p>To reiterate, these required courses often provide tangential learning for specific aspects of Computer Science, giving the students a broad understanding of the entire field to then specialize in upper-division classes. More importantly, they teach one of the most valuable skills in any engineering field, problem-solving. I’m not looking for these arguments to necessarily change your mind, but I hope they provide a different perspective on the idea of required courses.</p><p>And also, Physics is fun yo.</p></section><footer class="container"><div class="center go-back"><a href="/blog">See more posts</a></div></footer></article></div></main><script defer="defer" src="/js/helper.js"></script></body></html>
